Lab 2
</i></b></font>

<p>Deadline: TBA.</p>

<p><b> Part 1 - Fundamental frequency estimation</b>

</p><ol type="1">

<li>Using the Octave/Matlab tools, compute the fundamental
  frequency of one vowel segment of one of the speech files <i>vowels_nnnnn.wav</i>, by
  detecting the local maximum of the autocorrelation function.
</li><li>After developing the code to analyse a single window, generalize
  to analyse a whole speech file. Use one of the two
  <i>birthdate_nnnnn.wav</i>  files (no need to test on both).  Write
  the computed F0 values (one frame per line, values in Hz) to a file named
  <i>birthdate_nnnnn.myf0</i>. Unvoiced frames should correspond to
  zero values. Compute
  the average F0 for that file (excluding the zero values).
</li><li>Compare these results with the ones obtained by the Praat
  or Wavesurfer tools
  (<i>birthdate_nnnnn.f0</i>), with similar parametrization. The
  results should be written in a text file <i>f0_results.txt</i>, with the
  following contents:
<ul>
  <li>Average F0 (tool): --- Hz
  </li><li>Average F0 (autocorr.):  --- Hz
</li></ul>
</li></ol>

<p><b> Part 2 - Linear prediction</b>

</p><ol type="1">

<li>Write a function that computes the residual of linear prediction. The function
should be flexible enough to allow different choices of 
analysis window length and interval, and prediction order.
Suggestions: Use the function <i>lpcauto</i> of the 
<i>voicebox</i> toolbox publicly available for Matlab to compute the
  linear prediction coefficients for a whole speech file, and then use
  the function <i>filter</i> to compute the corresponding residual. 
  
</li><li>Test the function on one of the files <i>birthdate_nnnnn.wav</i> from the group,
producing the file <i>birthdate_nnnnn_res.wav</i>, using the
autocorrelation method, windows of 20 ms, overlapping by 50%, and
 prediction order 16.

</li><li>Using for instance <i>wavesurfer</i>, plot the magnitude of the
  short-time
  spectra of the original and residual signals (superimposed) for a
  vowel segment.

</li><li>Compare the results of the function for the following conditions:
<ul>
<li>analysis window length - 20 ms and 10 ms
</li><li>analysis window interval - 10 ms and 5 ms
</li><li>prediction order - 16 and 10
</li></ul>
Write brief comments in file <i>lpc_results.txt</i>.


</li><li>Implement the inverse function, that is, the function that receives as input
  arguments the prediction coefficients and the residual signal, and computes
  the resynthesized signal. Test it with the file produced in the previous
  exercise, yielding <i>birthdate_nnnnn_syn.wav</i>

</li></ol>


<p><b> Part 3 - Vocoder simulation</b> 

</p><ol type="1">

  <li>
  Simulate an unquantized LPC vocoder model and test it with file <i>birthdate_nnnnn.wav</i>. The original residual signal, which is the ideal excitation, should be replaced by an artificial excitation which is a pulse train in voiced frames, and white noise in unvoiced frames. The reconstructed signal should be stored in file <i>birthdate_nnnnn_voc.wav</i>.

<br>Suggestion: start by simulating the vocoder scheme with a
  simpler excitation signal in which each frame is either unvoiced or
  voiced with a constant pitch (as computed in Part 1).
</li></ol>

<p><b> Part 4 - Formant synthesizer</b>

</p><ol type="1">

<li>Implement a function that simulates a rudimentary formant vowel
  synthesizer. The function receives as input the vowel (eventually coded as an
  integer value), the fundamental frequency (in Hz), the respective duration
  (in seconds), and intensity. The synthesizer should have 4 formants,
  whose locations
  have been previously stored in a table. In order to build this table, use the 
Wavesurfer tool, and save the data of the formant plot panel. Use a fixed bandwidth for each formant, equivalent to
having a pole magnitude of 0.95, in order to have poles near the unit
circumference, thus creating distinct resonances. Keep the intensity fixed, for
the whole duration. Store the results in file
  <i>formant_synthesis_fixed.wav</i>. Check the formants in this file
  with formant plot in Wavesurfer.

</li><li>Modify the previous function in order to synthesize a vowel whose
  fundamental frequency and intensity may vary between pairs of values given as
  input. Store the results in file <i>formant_synthesis_var.wav</i>.

</li><li>Optional: Modify the previous functions in order to synthesize a sequence of
  two vowels.

</li><li>Optional: Introduce modifications in the location, and bandwidth of the
  first 3
  formants and observe the respective JND.
</li></ol>

<p>Note: Please submit your work in a zip file including all the above
mentioned files (in italic) and the implemented code. The file should
contain 4 different folders, one for each of the parts of this lab
assignment. Although the
students are advised to used the <i>vowels_nnnnn.wav</i> for
debugging their code, the zip file should only include the
corresponding files for <i>birthdate_nnnnn.wav</i>, for <b>one</b> of the
students of the group (i.e. just choose one of the two
<i>birthdate_nnnnn.wav</i> files of the group for inclusion).
