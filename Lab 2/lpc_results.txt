To compare the tests we looked at the energy of the residual in a voiced segment of the original signal. We also analyzed the short time magnitude spectrum of the same segments.

Window duration (10 or 20 ms): Fixing overlap at 50% and prediction order at 16 the residual energy with window duration of 10ms is bigger than 20 ms . Meaning there's a bigger error with a smaller window duration.

Window Overlap (0% , 50%m or 75%): Fixing window duration at 20ms and prediction order at 16 we varied the interval between 5,10 and 20ms getting a corresponding overlap of 75%,50% and 0%. with overlap of 50% we get the least energy from the residual while with 75% overlap we get the most energy from the residual. therefore an overlap of 50% is prefered so that the coefficients calculated with each window are used to describe parts of the signal where the window possesses high values.

Prediction order :By varying the order of the LPC filter in the wavesurfer tool we can see that the formants are modeled with every 2 poles added to the filter corresponding to an increase of 2 in p. However with too high value of p the filter will start to model individual harmonics. With p=16 this problem is starting occur.
