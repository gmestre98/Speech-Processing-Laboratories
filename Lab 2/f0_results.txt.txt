The file we used to do this was the file 'birthdate_87005.wav', for this we obtained
	- Average F0 (Wavesurfer): 145.13 Hz
	- Average F0 (Autocorrelation using Matlab): 146.01 Hz

At first we had a higher average F0 obtained with our code, getting something like 170 Hz.
To improve this, we introduced a limit on how low the energy could be for us to read some frequency on a give window, therefore removing some values that could introduce an error.
This helped to remove also a lit of noise.
After this improvement we obtained a value of 159 Hz. But since in this audio file it is recorded the voice of a man, we thought it wouldn't make sense for us to search for periods
corresponding to frequencies between 60 Hz and 400 Hz, because the voice of a man doesn't hit such high frequencies usually on normal pitch.
So, to tackle this we changed that maximum frequency down to 220 Hz, which we thought would make more sense, even thought it is still a little high.
